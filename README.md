# ChunkShield
Feature Rich Lightweight Chunk Protection that limits mobs, named mobs, blocks, entities, and entities in bulk.

## Versions
- 1.21.x

## "But Paper/Spigot already do this"
Think of ChunkShield as an extension for Paper/Spigot. 
- Chunkshield addresses aspects that Paper/Spigot neglect.
- Where ClearLagg failed, ChunkShield succeeds.
- We cut all the useless bloat and focus on what server owners specifically need.

## Simplicity
- ChunkShield is straight to the point!
- Only need one command: */cshield reload*
- Only need one permission: *chunkshield.reload*

## Features
- Limit Certain Blocks within a Chunk.
- Limit All Boats / All Minecart within a Chunk.
- Limit Certain Entities within a Chunk.
- Limit Certain Named Entities within a Chunk.
- Automatic Protection/Priority over Named Entities.
- Configuration that does not require a Google Search to understand.
- Drop and Go Ready! Default Config does not interfere with vanilla gameplay.
- Lightweight, all checks are made with performance in mind.

## Our Message
ClearLagg's complete incompetence left a bad taste and a lot of misinformation, preventing future security development and putting thousands of servers at risk.

A lot of server owners are brushed away from needing additional security and are gaslit to put up with Paper/Spigot.

So I aim to provide server owners with the plugin I always wanted.
