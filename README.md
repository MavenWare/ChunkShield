## "But Paper/Spigot already do this"
Think of ChunkShield as an extension for Paper/Spigot. 
- Chunkshield addresses aspects that Paper/Spigot neglect.
- Where ClearLagg failed, ChunkShield succeeds.
- We cut all the useless bloat and focus on what server owners specifically need.

## Simplicity
- ChunkShield offers all the protections you could want.
- No unnecessary or obscure features that inadvertently put your server at risk.

## Features
- Limit Certain Blocks / Entities / Named Entities within a Chunk.
- Radius Limit for Boats/Rafts/Minecarts
- Alerts for who and where.
- Togglable checks and conditions.
- Automatic Protection/Priority over Named Entities.
- Drop and Go Ready! Default Config does not interfere with vanilla gameplay.
- Lightweight, all checks are made with performance in mind.

## Our Message
ClearLagg's overcompensation left a bad taste and a lot of misinformation, preventing future security development and putting thousands of servers at risk.

A lot of server owners are brushed away from needing additional security and are gaslit to put up with Paper/Spigot.

So I aim to provide server owners with the plugin I always wanted.
