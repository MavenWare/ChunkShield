Feature-Rich Lightweight Protection for entity/block limits per chunk, including named entities.

*Backport Requests will cost $20 and will be made public upon release as my guarantee.*

## Simplicity
You only need one command: */cshield reload*

No unnecessary commands that take hours to setup like ClearLagg.

Permissions not necessary except to reload.

## Our Message
ClearLagg's complete incompetence left a bad taste and a lot of misinformation, preventing future security development and putting thousands of servers at risk.

A lot of server owners are brushed away from needing additional security and are gaslit to put up with Paper/Spigot.

So I aim to provide server owners with the plugin I always wanted.
