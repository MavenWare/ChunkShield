# FAQ

### Will this lag my server?
- No. There are multiple conditions added(as of 1.0.1) that have to be met for a chunk to get scanned.

### Do you still have the old Scheduled Chunk Scanning?
- No. Chunk Scanning is no longer scheduled and will not scan all loaded chunks going forward.

### Why should people even bother adding this?
- ChunkShield is meant to be dropped and forgotten. It prevents varying ways that someone could spam to lag or crash your server.
- Spam mitigation is left solely up to the server owner as Spigot and Mojang have no default ready-made barriers.

### I don't want XYZ feature.
- You can toggle all features on or off.
